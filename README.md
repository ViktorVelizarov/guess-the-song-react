## Description
Guess The Song is a web app that makes you guess a random song from your own Spotify Library. You have 15 seconds to listen to a short preview of the selected song and write it's name. This is a practice solo project I made to improve my React skills and learn how to use web API calls. You can try the app here: (https://guess-the-song-vvv.netlify.app/)
